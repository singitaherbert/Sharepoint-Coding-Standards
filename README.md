# Sharepoint-Coding-Standards
Here are some SharePoint coding standards and best practices that will help maintain code quality, performance, and scalability when developing SharePoint solutions:

# 1. **General Best Practices
   - **Follow SOLID principles** for object-oriented design.
   - **Use C# for SharePoint development**, especially for web parts and custom workflows.
   - Avoid hardcoding strings or configurations. Store configurations in a configurable and centralized location, like a property bag, SharePoint lists, or a config file.

# 2. **Development Environment**
   - **Develop on a SharePoint-compatible environment** to ensure that all solutions are compatible with the platform version you are targeting.
   - Use **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)** for modern SharePoint web parts, extensions, and apps.

# 3. **Namespaces and Class Structure**
   - **Use proper namespaces** that reflect the functionality. Namespaces should be descriptive and organized (e.g., `CompanyName.ProjectName.SharePointWebPart`).
   - Keep class names short but descriptive and ensure **proper encapsulation** of functionality.

# 4. **Performance Considerations**
   - **Minimize the use of CAML queries**, and avoid querying large lists without filters. Instead, use pagination and indexed columns where possible.
   - **Use Content Search Web Parts (CSWP) or the Search API** for large data retrieval rather than querying directly from lists.
   - Cache results wherever possible using **Output Cache**, **Object Cache**, or **Distributed Cache** to avoid unnecessary data retrieval from SharePoint lists or databases.

# 5. **Use of Features**
   - When creating customizations, ensure **Features are scoped appropriately** (Farm, Web Application, Site, Web).
   - Avoid deploying solutions as Farm solutions if possible. Prefer **SharePoint Add-ins or SPFx** for greater flexibility.

# 6. **JavaScript and Client-Side Code**
   - When using JavaScript, follow modern practices like **ES6+** syntax and modular patterns.
   - Avoid inline scripts; use **JSLink or Custom Actions** to reference scripts, or use SPFx where possible.
   - Use **REST APIs** and the **PnP JS Library** for interacting with SharePoint data from client-side code.
   - Ensure all **AJAX calls** are asynchronous to prevent blocking the UI thread.

# 7. **CSS and UI/UX Considerations**
   - Use **SharePoint CSS classes and themes** wherever possible for styling consistency. Avoid overwriting core SharePoint styles unless necessary.
   - For custom styling, use **CSS files**, or prefer **SCSS/LESS** for modular styles.
   - Ensure that customizations are **responsive** and **cross-browser compatible**.

# 8. **Error Handling**
   - Implement **try-catch blocks** around all SharePoint API calls and custom code. Log all exceptions for debugging purposes.
   - Use SharePointâ€™s **ULS logging** for critical errors and application diagnostics.

# 9. **Disposal of SharePoint Objects**
   - **Dispose of objects** properly to avoid memory leaks, especially **SPSite** and **SPWeb** objects.
   - Use **`using` statements** to ensure objects like SPSite, SPWeb, and SPListItemCollection are properly disposed of after use.

# 10. **Use SharePoint Patterns and Practices (PnP)**
   - Take advantage of the **PnP Core Component library** for SharePoint development, which includes helpful utilities and reusable components.
   - Follow **PnP guidance** for custom development, especially when working with provisioning, branding, and list data management.

# 11. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Use **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code** with appropriate extensions (such as for SPFx development).
   - Ensure **unit tests** cover important business logic.
   - Perform **performance testing** for large list retrievals and workflows, especially when handling large datasets.
   - Ensure that solutions are **backward-compatible** and work across different SharePoint versions (On-Prem and Online, if applicable).

# 12. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Document all custom code, especially custom workflows, timers, and event receivers.
   - Use proper XML comments for methods and class definitions.
   - Follow a **consistent naming convention** across all your solutions.
